All work here is public domain with no restrictions whatsoever.  I hereby declare my permanent opposition in principle to ANY "intellectual property" of any kind whatsoever.  
I further declare opposition to ANYONE attempting to make a profit in bank-debt currency from writing software.  I will NEVER cooperate in ANY 
way with the global rule of the propertarians.  I refuse to use any of the various "license" under the so-called "rule of law" which 
supposedly "grant" "rights" to other people.  I refuse to acknowledge the validity of any such rights under any cicumstances whatsoever.  I am prepared to die for my beliefs. Are you?
